# P.R.I.S.M-5th_SEM_EL
## Repository Overview

This repository contains the trained machine learning models along with the corresponding Google Colab notebooks used for training and inference.

To execute the notebooks in Google Colab, users are required to mount their Google Drive and place all trained model files in the mounted Drive directory. The notebooks are configured to load the models directly from Google Drive during runtime.

**Note:**  
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inference service is exposed using **ngrok** to enable secure external access during execution.
For CNN please see the cnn_run_steps.txt file
